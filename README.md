# EEG_MUSIC_TESTING

This repository provides the **replication package**, **analysis scripts**, and **supplementary materials** for the paper.

---

## Replication Package

In the `/replication` directory, you will find the zip file `prophet_eeg_study.zip` along with a README containing instructions on how to replicate the experiment using the customized Prophet tool.

## Music Links

The study used the albums *Blue Note*, *Down Hill*, *Dune Days*, and *Palette* from **LofiGirl**.
Due to copyright restrictions, the audio files cannot be redistributed here. Please access them via the following links:

* [Blue Note – Bandcamp](https://lofigirl.bandcamp.com/album/blue-note)

## Forms

The `/forms` directory contains all **pre-experiment forms** used in the study.

---

## Raw EEG Data

The raw EEG recordings (~6 GB) are not included in this repository due to their size and privacy restrictions.
They are available upon request. Please contact us at: eegmusicstudy@gmail.com

## Data Results

The `/data` directory provides all results from the experiment, organized as follows:

* **Wave_ELE**: Power of specific waves by **electrode** and activity.
* **Wave_IND**: Power of specific waves by **participant** and activity.
* **Wave_REG**: Power of specific waves by **brain region** and activity.

---

## Statistics

The `/statistic` directory contains the **statistical results** from the experiment.

---

## Analysis

Analysis scripts are provided in the `/scripts` directory for data processing and replication.

### Requirements

* **MATLAB R2018b** or later
* **EEGLAB v2023.1** or later

### Execution Order

1. Run **`ICA.m`** using all `.EDF` files from the experiment.
2. Execute **`Unified_GUI.m`** with all `.SET` files generated by `ICA.m`.
3. Run either:

   * **`eeg_q_Script.m`**
   * **`eeg_q_Unified_Region_Script.m`**
     using the `.SET` files produced by `Unified_GUI.m`.

> If you need to merge `.EDF` files, you can use the provided **`MergeEDF.m`** script.
