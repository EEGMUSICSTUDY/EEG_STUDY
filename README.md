# EEG_MUSIC_TESTING

This repository provides the **replication package**, **analysis scripts**, and **supplementary materials** for the paper.

---

## Replication Package

In the `/replication` directory, you will find:

* **Tasks**: All stimuli presented to participants (`/tasks` folder).
* **Baseline images**: Reference images used for baseline conditions.
* **Prophet tool**: A task viewer and task editor are provided in the `/task_viewer` directory, along with the corresponding `.xml` configuration file.

  * For details on how to use the Prophet tool, please visit the official repository: [Prophet GitHub](https://github.com/feigensp/Prophet).

## Forms

The `/forms` directory contains all **pre-experiment forms** used in the study.

---

## Selenium Guideline

The `/SeleniumGuideline` directory includes a short **guideline** designed to:

* Familiarize users with the experimental environment.
* Remind participants of the most frequently used functions during automated testing.

---

## Data Results

The `/data` directory provides all results from the experiment, organized as follows:

* **Wave_ELE**: Power of specific waves by **electrode** and activity.
* **Wave_IND**: Power of specific waves by **participant** and activity.
* **Wave_REG**: Power of specific waves by **brain region** and activity.

---

## Statistics

The `/statistic` directory contains the **statistical results** from the experiment.

---

## Analysis

Analysis scripts are provided in the `/scripts` directory for data processing and replication.

### Requirements

* **MATLAB R2018b** or later
* **EEGLAB v2023.1** or later

### Execution Order

1. Run **`ICA.m`** using all `.EDF` files from the experiment.
2. Execute **`Unified_GUI.m`** with all `.SET` files generated by `ICA.m`.
3. Run either:

   * **`eeg_q_Script.m`**
   * **`eeg_q_Unified_Region_Script.m`**
     using the `.SET` files produced by `Unified_GUI.m`.

> If you need to merge `.EDF` files, you can use the provided **`MergeEDF.m`** script.
